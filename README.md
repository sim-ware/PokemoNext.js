# PokémoNext.js
First steps in the `Next.js` &amp; Pokémon battle logic ecosystems.

### API
The Game Management and Battle Logic uses `Next.js` handling of 'API Routes'; 

['a solution to build you API with Next.js. Any file inside the folder pages/api is mapped to /api/* and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page. They are server-side only bundles and won't increase your client-side bundle size.'](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes "Next.js API Routes Docs")
